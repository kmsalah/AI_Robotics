# SLAM - Robot Control System
## Simultaneous Localization And Mapping

This project is a practice implementation of a SLAM module and a robot control system for navigating through a world. 

Part 1 of this project focuses on developing the SLAM implmentation to process a sequence of measurements and movement updates related
to landmarks (gems). The movements are pre-defined and are processed as given. An online version of SLAM is used to handle 
an unknown number of motions. Noise is taken into account for the movements and measurements.

Part 2 of this project creates an action planner using the SLAM module. The purpose of the planner is to navigate
through an environment and extract a list of gems.
